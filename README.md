#SUDOKU

**SUDOKU** is a multiplayer sudoku game, open source with GPL Lisence. [Demo](http://sudoku.meteor.com)

SUDOKU is currently in development. rule and interface is uncertain, fork me and pull request for your good idea.

This code is desgined for only one gamespace, and I suggest to deploy **your own**

1. git clone this repo to somewhere
2. cd somewhere && meteor (run at your local)
3. cd somewhere && meteor deploy subdomain.meteor.com (deploy your game online)


Powerd and hosted by [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com).

Todo list
1. Games model for puzzle stroge
2. Use coffeescript
3. Use less
